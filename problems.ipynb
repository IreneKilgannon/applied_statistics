    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The lady tasting tea is a famous statistical experiment devised by [Ronald A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) to investigate a woman's claim that she could distinguish whether milk was poured first into a cup of tea or if the tea was poured in first. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original experiment eight cups of tea were presented to the lady - four with milk first and four with tea first. They were identical in all other respects and were presented in a _random_ order. Fisher aimed to calculate the probability, _p_ that the lady was selecting the four milk first cups purely by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this experiment, Fisher introduced the null hypothesis, _H<sub>0</sub>_ and the alternative hypothesis,  _H<sub>a</sub>_. The null hypothesis is the default position and is assumed to be true unless proven otherwise. The alternative hypothesis opposes the null hypothesis and assumes a relationship between the variables. As stated in this article, Alternative Hypothesis: Definition, Types and Examples on [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/alternative-hypothesis-definition-types-and-examples/)  \n",
    ">\"The null and alternative hypotheses are exhaustive, meaning that together they cover every possible outcome. They are also mutually exclusive, meaning that only one can be true at a time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Null Hypothesis _H<sub>0</sub>_:__\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* The lady has no special powers to tell the difference between cups of tea with milk in first and cups of tea with tea in first.\n",
    ">* The lady is selecting the four cups from eight at random.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">__Alternative Hypothesis _H<sub>a</sub>_:__\n",
    ">* The lady can tell the difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomisation of the order of the cups and the order in which the cups were presented to the lady is a key component of the experiment. As discussed in [The historical and statistical significance of the lady tasting tea experiment](https://jyyna.co.uk/lady-tasting-tea/) randomisation eliminates selection bias ensuring that each cup has an equal chance of being selected and facilitates statistical analysis as statistical tests assume randomness. As an aside, the author replicated the experiment with his friends - none of them could match the lady's accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability](https://statisticsbyjim.com/probability/probability-fundamentals/) is the measure of likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is impossible and 1 is certain. A low _p_ indicates evidence against the null hypothesis. [Combinatorial maths](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics/combinatorics/) is used to calculate the probability of the lady selecting at random the four milk in first cups from eight cups. The [class lecture notes](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics/blob/main/materials/lady-tasting-tea.ipynb) provides a more detailed explanation of how to perform this calculation with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    " $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ where ${n}$ is the total number of cups and ${k}$ is the number of cups with milk in first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this equation the probability, _p_ of correctly identifying at random all four milk first cups is 1/70. In other words, if she is choosing at random, she has a one in seventy chance or a probability of 0.014 of correctly selecting the four cups with milk in first. Fisher also chose a significance level, α of 0.05. As he states in page 13 of [The Design of Experiments](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~shalab/anova/DOE-RAF.pdf): \n",
    ">\"It is open to the experimenter to be more or less exacting in respect of the smallness of the probability he would require before he would be willing to admit that his observations have demonstrated a positive result\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability of selecting the four cups at random is smaller than the significance level we can say that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis.  \n",
    "As the lady correctly selected all four milk first cups we can say that she can indeed detect if milk or tea has been poured first into the cup. \n",

    "### Simulate the Experiment Using NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem requires the use of numpy to simulate the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key steps are:\n",
    "1. Set the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, and significance level. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   >__Null Hypothesis _H<sub>0</sub>_:__\n",
    "    >* The lady has no special powers to tell the difference between cups of tea with milk in first and cups of tea with tea in first.\n",
    "    >* The lady is selecting the four cups from twelve at random.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    >__Alternative Hypothesis _H<sub>a</sub>_:__\n",
    "    >* The lady can tell the difference. \n",
    "    >\n",
    "    >__Significance level, α:__ 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decide on the number of times to repeat the experiment. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   As the brief says 'many times', I chose to repeat the experiment 10,000,000 times. This will give a more accurate estimate. \n",
    "3. Set up a counter to track the number of successful outcomes. \n",
    "4. Set up a numpy array with 12 labels from 0 to 11 inclusive. These are the twelve cups. \n",
    "5. Shuffle the labels using [numpy.random.shuffle()](https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.shuffle.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "   This function randomly rearranges elements within an array in-place. Each run may produce a different permutation. \n",
    "6. Choose four labels from the cups array to be milk in first. \n",
    "\n",
    "   To choose four cups from the array, the function [numpy.random.choice()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) was used. It has three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a: the array to sample from\n",
    "    size: the number of elements to select (4)\n",
    "    replace: either True or False. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If the replace parameter is True it samples with replacement. For this experiment ``replace = False`` as we want sample without replacement. When a cup is selected we do not it replaced back into the array again. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The array is sorted in ascending order with np.sort(). This will make the comparison step between the two arrays simpler as the position of the element matters when comparing arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using numpy.random.choice() randomly select and sort four labels from the cups array as the guess as to which cups have milk added first. \n",
    "8. Do the labels match? Compare the milk in first array and the guess array with [numpy's array_equal() function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array_equal.html). With array_equal() it was necessary to sort the arrays in ascending order as p. This step could also be performed with [np.all() or np.array_equiv()](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-numpy-ndarray-compare/). \n",
    "9.  If the arrays match, store the result as success. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Calculate the probability. \n",
