    "``Histograms`` are used for plotting continuous data. A good histogram can indicate if the data has a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib's [plt.hist](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/hist.html) and seaborn's sns.hisplot function ([see official documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html)) can both plot histograms. Seaborn is a plotting library built on top of matplotlib. Datacamp has a nice tutorial on making [histograms with seaborn](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-make-a-seaborn-histogram).\n",

    "For this problem, seaborn.hisplot was used to create the histograms. Seaborn.histplot has the kde parameter, which creates a kernel density plot over the histogram. KDE provides a smooth estimate of the data distribution and can be useful for identifying patterns. Matplotlib.hist does not have an equivalent parameter. \n",

    "_Alpha_:\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha parameter ([see matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/set_alpha.html)) controls the transparency level of a plot. Alpha ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). \n",

    "_Bins_:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bins in a histogram are the intervals into which a dataset is divided. The number of bins influences the shape of the plot. If the number of bins is not specified, seaborn calculates the number of bins. For this plot, too many bins were generated with the default setting, so ``np.linspace`` was used to specify the number of bins. As the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) states, np.linspace returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.\n",

    "The numerator for both equations subtracts either the population mean or the sample mean from a data point. \n",

    "The sample mean, $\\overline{x}$, tends to be smaller than the population mean, $\\mu$, as it is calculated from sample data and is therefore closer to the sample points than the true population mean $\\sigma$. For the sample standard deviation, if we divide by $N$ the resulting estimate of the population mean would be consistently too small. To account for this the formula for sample standard deviation uses a denominator of ${N - 1}$. This adjustment is called Bessel's correction. Its purpose, as stated in this [Reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/km51c/what_exactly_does_bessels_correction_do_when/), is to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This YouTube video, [Why dividing by n underestimates the variance?](https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=sHRBg6BhKjI) explains why Bessel's correction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, dividing by ${N - 1}$ compensates for the fact that we calculate differences from the sample mean rather than the population mean. The resulting estimated population standard deviation calculated with sample values would be consistently underestimated if the divisor were $N$."

The video confirmed my findings that a large shift in the mean increases the power of the test. This problem did not explore the effect of increasing the sample size, but, as explained in the video, increasing the sample size will increase the power of the test. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem in this notebook focuses on different fundamental concepts in applied statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 1: Lady Tasting Tea__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lady Tasting Tea experiment explored key concepts in hypothesis testing such as null and alternative hypothesis, significance levels and _p_-values. By simulating random selections, we estimated the probability of correctly identifying milk-first cups by chance and compared it to the pre-selected significance level, demonstrating how _p_-values guide decisions to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 12-cup Lady Tasting Tea experiment simulated, a _p_-value of 0.002 was calculated. This is below the significance level of 0.05 so there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis if the four milk first cups are chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 2: Normal Distribution__\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical tests assume that the data is normally distributed. For this problem, samples were generated using NumPy from both a normal distribution and a standard normal distribution. The population and sample standard deviations were calculated, and the differences between them explained in terms of Bessel's correction, and sample size. Sample standard deviation serves an estimate of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of the population standard deviation is smaller than the sample standard deviation. Increasing the sample size would result in the sample standard deviations converging on the population standard deviation. As the sample gets larger, the sample mean becomes closer to the population mean. This example demonstrates the importance of adequate sample size in statistical calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 3: _t_-tests__\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 3 explored independent _t_-tests for comparing the means of two groups. It examined how the size of the difference in means between the two groups affected the Type II error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the difference in means increased, the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis decreased, reducing likelihood of Type II errors. The larger the difference in means between two groups makes it easier to detect true differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 4: ANOVA__\n",
    "\n",
    "The means of three independent groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and multiple _t_-tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA demonstrated that at least two groups differently significantly, while multiple _t_-tests highlighted the increased risk of Type I errors. ANOVA followed by a post hoc test, such as Tukey's HSD, is the preferred approach for testing multiple groups simultaneously. "
