    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The lady tasting tea is a famous statistical experiment devised by [Ronald A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) to investigate a woman's claim that she could distinguish whether milk was poured first into a cup of tea or if the tea was poured in first. This [Irish TImes article](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/how-a-tea-tasting-test-led-to-a-breakthrough-in-statistics-1.3998786) provides a easy to understand explanation of the lady tasting tea experiment for the non-statistician. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original experiment eight cups of tea were presented to the lady - four with milk first and four with tea first. They were identical in all other respects and were presented in a _random_ order. Fisher aimed to calculate the probability, _p_ that the lady was selecting the four milk first cups purely by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this experiment, Fisher introduced the ``null hypothesis``, _H<sub>0</sub>_ and the ``alternative hypothesis``,  _H<sub>a</sub>_. The null hypothesis is the default position and is assumed to be true unless proven otherwise. The alternative hypothesis opposes the null hypothesis and assumes a relationship between the variables. As stated in this article, [Alternative Hypothesis: Definition, Types and Examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/alternative-hypothesis-definition-types-and-examples/)  \n",
    ">\"The null and alternative hypotheses are exhaustive, meaning that together they cover every possible outcome. They are also mutually exclusive, meaning that only one can be true at a time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For the original lady tasting tea experiment the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Null Hypothesis _H<sub>0</sub>_:__\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* The lady has no special powers to tell the difference between cups of tea with milk in first and cups of tea with tea in first.\n",
    ">* The lady is selecting the four cups from eight at random.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">__Alternative Hypothesis _H<sub>a</sub>_:__\n",
    ">* The lady can tell the difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomisation of the order of the cups and the order in which the cups were presented to the lady is a key component of the experiment. As discussed in [The historical and statistical significance of the lady tasting tea experiment](https://jyyna.co.uk/lady-tasting-tea/) randomisation eliminates selection bias ensuring that each cup has an equal chance of being selected and facilitates statistical analysis as statistical tests assume randomness. As an aside, the author replicated the experiment with his friends - none of them could match the lady's accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "[Probability](https://statisticsbyjim.com/probability/probability-fundamentals/) is the measure of likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is impossible and 1 is certain. A low _p_ indicates evidence against the null hypothesis. [Combinatorial maths](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics/combinatorics/) is used to calculate the probability of the lady selecting at random the four milk in first cups from eight cups. The [class lecture notes by Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/applied-statistics/blob/main/materials/lady-tasting-tea.ipynb) provides a more detailed explanation of how to perform this calculation with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    " $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ where ${n}$ is the total number of cups and ${k}$ is the number of cups with milk in first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this equation the probability, _p_ of correctly identifying at random all four milk first cups, where ${n}$ is 8 and ${k}$ is 4 is 1/70. In other words, if she is choosing at random, she has a one in seventy chance or a probability of 0.014 of correctly selecting the four cups with milk in first. Fisher also chose a significance level, α of 0.05. As he states in page 13 of [The Design of Experiments](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~shalab/anova/DOE-RAF.pdf): \n",
    ">\"It is open to the experimenter to be more or less exacting in respect of the smallness of the probability he would require before he would be willing to admit that his observations have demonstrated a positive result\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A p-value below the significance level of 0.05 indicates that there is a less than 5% chance of observing the results if the null hypothesis were true. ADD reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability of selecting the four cups at random is smaller than the significance level we can say that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis.  \n",
    "As the lady correctly selected all four milk first cups we can say that she can indeed detect if milk or tea has been poured first into the cup. "

Plot histograms of both sets of values on the same axes with transparency. Describe the differences you see. Explain how you expect these differences to change if the sample size is increased."
