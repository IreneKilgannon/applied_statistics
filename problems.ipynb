Variance is based on the square differences between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation can be easier to explain as it has the same unit as the mean.\n",

Its purpose, as stated in this [reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/km51c/what_exactly_does_bessels_correction_do_when/) is to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance. If we were to divide by $N$ instead, the resulting estimate would be consistently too small because the sample mean, $\\overline{x}$ is calculated from sample data and is therefore closer to the sample points than the true population mean, $\\sigma$. With a small sample, the sample mean, $\\overline{x}$ is often a poor estimator of the population mean, $\\mu$ which artificially shrinks the squared deviations.\n",
