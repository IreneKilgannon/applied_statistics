This compares to a probability of 0.014 for the original eight cup experiment. Since the probability is below the significance level (α = 0.05), there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis if the lady does correctly identify the four milk first cups. We can then conclude that the lady can tell the difference between the milk first and tea first cups. "

    "The final part of this problem is to consider extending or relaxing the p-value threshold compared to the original design. Choosing the significance level at the outset of the experiment is a key component of making a statistical analysis. I would neither extend nor relax the p-value threshold based on the results of the experiment! The question of whether it is ever good to increase the significance level was posed on [stackexchange.com](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24203/is-it-ever-good-to-increase-significance-level):\n",

    "Changing the significance level to decide what is statistically significant after the experiment is never good practice. The practice of manipulating data or statistical analyses to find statistically significant results is called [p-hacking](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/p-hacking/) or [data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging).\n",

    "Now, could I have give more consideration to extending or relaxing the threshold level compared to the original experiment at the start of the modified experiment? Possibly. The most commonly used significance levels are 0.05 and 0.01. The choice of the significance level can be influenced by the consequences of the result of false positive or false negative values. An example of this is given in this article, [Understanding Significance Levels](https://www.statsig.com/blog/understanding-significance-levels-a-key-to-accurate-data-analysis) where in fields like medicine false negatives can have serious consequences. \n",
