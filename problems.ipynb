Variance is based on the square differences between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation can be easier to explain as it has the same unit as the mean.\n",

Its purpose, as stated in this [reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/km51c/what_exactly_does_bessels_correction_do_when/) is to provide an unbiased estimate of the population variance. If we were to divide by $N$ instead, the resulting estimate would be consistently too small because the sample mean, $\\overline{x}$ is calculated from sample data and is therefore closer to the sample points than the true population mean, $\\sigma$. With a small sample, the sample mean, $\\overline{x}$ is often a poor estimator of the population mean, $\\mu$ which artificially shrinks the squared deviations.\n",

The factor $N-1$ has a larger correctional effect when $N$ is small. As $N$ becomes larger the sample mean is likely to be a good estimator of the population mean. \n",

    "The plot shows that the mean of the population standard deviation, $\\mu$ = 0.92 is smaller than the mean of the sample standard deviation, $\\mu$ = 0.97. This difference is expected as the sample standard deviation is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation. Sample standard deviations tend to be slightly larger on average because they rely on limited data and therefore introduce additional variability. The sample mean, $\\overline{x}$ tends to be smaller than the population mean, $\\mu$."
