    "\n",
    "Histograms are used for plotting continuous data. A good histogram can indicate if the data has a normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms can be plotted with either matplotlib's, [plt.hist](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/hist.html) or with seaborn's, sns.hisplot function ([see official documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html)). Seaborn is a plotting library built on top of matplotlib. Datacamp has a nice tutorial on making [histograms with seaborn](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-make-a-seaborn-histogram).\n",

    "\n",
    "Seaborn.hisplot was used to create the histograms as seaborn.histplot has the kde parameter which creates a kernel density plot over the histogram. KDE provides a smooth estimate of the data distribution and can be useful for identifying patterns in the data. Matplotlib.hist does not have an equivalent parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Alpha_:\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha parameter ([see matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/set_alpha.html)) is used to control the transparency level of a plot. Alpha has a range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). \n",
    "\n",
    "_Bins_:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bins in a histogram are the intervals into which a dataset is divided. Selecting the right number of bins is important as the number of bins influences the shape of the plot. If the number of bins is not given, seaborn will create what it thinks is the optimal number of bins. For this plot, too many bins were created with the default setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "np.linspace was used to specify the number of bins. As the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) states, np.linspace returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.\n",
